## Usage

To run the application, you need to start both the back-end and front-end servers in **two separate terminal windows**.

#### 1. Start the Back-End Server (API)

In your **first terminal**, navigate to the Rails directory and run:
```sh
rails s
```
> Leave this terminal running. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### 2. Start the Front-End Server (UI)

In a **new, second terminal**, navigate to the front-end directory and run:
```sh
npm start
```
> Leave this terminal running. The front-end will be available at the address shown in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`).

#### 3. View the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to the front-end address (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`) to use the app.

## Running Tests

To run the automated test suite for the back-end, navigate to the Rails directory and execute:
```sh
